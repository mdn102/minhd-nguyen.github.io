## Technical Overview
 I developed my portfolio using react.js as a front end, node.js as a back-end, and MongoDB as storage data. I have implemented server-side using a popular technique for rendering client-side webpage on the server, then server will send the complete result to the client. In order to bundle the module, I have used Webpack which is a module bundler to bundle javascript, front-end assets.
